# EssBar

Prototype of an App that allows the user to scan the barcode or the ingredient list of a product in the supermarket as part of a university project. Based on preferences that the user has chosen the app will show whether the product is eligible for eating. In addition there is the possibility to get more detailed information on a product, compare two products or to analyse the long term usage of certain substances.

Focus were Usability and quick yes/no information so that it is not a necessity to go deeper into the app for a quick elegibility check.
